# Generating Uncertainty Maps

To generate uncertainty maps for your depth predictions, simply run the following script:

`python generate_uncertainty_map.py`

This will compute the uncertainty maps based on your model outputs and save the resulting images in the ../uncertainty_results/ directory.

Make sure the required input predictions and any model checkpoints are correctly placed and configured within the script before running. Adjust paths in the script as needed.
